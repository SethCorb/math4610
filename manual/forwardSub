Purpose: This uses forward substitution to solve a lower matrix and a vector.

Input: You must input a lower matrix and a vector.

Output: This routine returns the solution.

Code:
```
def forwardSub(L,b):
    sol = []
    n=len(L)
    for i in range(n):
        sol.append(b[i])
        for j in range(i):
            sol[i]=sol[i]-L[i][j]*sol[j]
        sol[i] = sol[i]/L[i][i]
    return sol
```
