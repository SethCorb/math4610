# Task 6

The Gauss Seidel method is also known as the method of successive displacement. It is used to solve linear equations. It is very similar to jacobi iteration. However, it only needs one storage vector because elements can be overwritten as it is computed. A downside is that it is harder to do it in parallel processing.
