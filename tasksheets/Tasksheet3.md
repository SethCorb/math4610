You can tell the error is second order because we have a slope of 2 when things are working intended on the right side. The code begins to fail at about h=10^(-6)

# Task 6

Shared libraries load programs when they start. This is nice because it allows yo uto have software ready to go that you are going to use on a project. It seems to be somewhat similar to packages in something like python, but more about things that you create yourself.
