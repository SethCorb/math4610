# Task 2

log-log plot of the error and h:

You can tell the error is second order because we have a slope of 2 when things are working intended on the right side. The code begins to fail at about h=10^(-6)

# Task 3

# Task 5

I created the shared library as requested. I created the files needed, such as the \_\_init\_\_.py. [link to init file](https://github.com/SethCorb/math4610/blob/d0d3bb89380b17086756f127e5f3437c49fe5c66/software/__init__.py). The rest of the files are in the folder below the file. I also used vim to create the init file.

# Task 6

Shared libraries load programs when they start. This is nice because it allows you to have software ready to go that you are going to use on a project. An upside seems to be that using one saves space on your system. A downside would be the installation of the library.
