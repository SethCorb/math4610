# Task 2

log-log plot of the error and h:

You can tell the error is second order because we have a slope of 2 when things are working intended on the right side. The code begins to fail at about h=10^(-6)

# Task 4

Python doesn't really use shared libraries from what I understand, but I did make these programs into a package that I can import into other code and use. 

# Task 5

# Task 6

Shared libraries load programs when they start. This is nice because it allows you to have software ready to go that you are going to use on a project. An upside seems to be that using one saves space on your system. A downside would be the installation of the library.
