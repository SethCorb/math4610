I ran this code by pressing the "run" button. It compiled automatically.

## Task 2

I created the description as requested. [link](https://github.com/SethCorb/math4610/blob/0199729524366c4944f26324a422e30d0deff518/README.md)

## Task 3

I created the table of contents file as requested.[link](https://github.com/SethCorb/math4610/blob/0199729524366c4944f26324a422e30d0deff518/manual/toc.md)

## Task 6:
Some types of finite differences are the forward, central, and backward differences. The difference between these is the direction that you are taking the difference in. As an example, the central difference goes half the distance of h in each direction of the point in question. It is analagous to right versus left versus center rectangular approximations of an integral.
