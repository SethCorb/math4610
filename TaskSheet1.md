Task 5: It seems to me that version control systems are very important, especially for projects with multiple people. 
They make sure everyone has the most up to date code and aren’t messing with each others work (perforce.com). 
At its essence, version control is all about keeping track of updates to code and allowing for the ability to “go back in time” to past versions (Atlassian.com).
